# Moving Object Recognition with OpenCV in Python

In this example, image preproccesing (grayscaling, gaussian blurring, background subtraction, morphological transformation), contours extraction and contours area thresholding is done in every video frame in order to draw on it a moving object.  
Every function used can be found in the OpenCV Library https://github.com/opencv/opencv and the code was developed with version 3.4.2.
